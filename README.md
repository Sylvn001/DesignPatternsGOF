# DesignPatterns - The 23 Gang Of Four Design Patterns

<h3> Creational Design Patterns (5) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Abstract Factory. Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type. </li>
  <li> Builder. Uses to create complex objects. </li>
  <li> Factory Method. Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.</li>
  <li> Prototype. Creates a new object from an existing object.</li>
  <li> Singleton. Ensures only one instance of an object is created.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Structural Design Patterns (7) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Adapter. Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes. </li>
  <li> Bridge. Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.</li>
  <li> Composite. Takes a group of objects into a single object.</li>
  <li> Decorator. Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.</li>
  <li> Facade. Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.</li>
  <li> Flyweight. Reduces the cost of complex object models.</li>
  <li> Proxy. Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.</li>
</ul>
<h3> Behavior Design Patterns (11) </h3>
<ul>
  <li> Chain of Responsibility. Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.</li>
   <li> Command. Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.</li>
   <li> Interpreter. Implements a specialized language.</li>
   <li> Iterator. Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.</li>
   <li> Mediator. Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.</li>
   <li> Memento. Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.</li>
   <li> Observer. Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.</li>
   <li> State. Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.</li>
   <li> Strategy. Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.</li>
   <li> Template Method. Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.</li>
   <li> Visitor. Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.</li>
  </ul>
